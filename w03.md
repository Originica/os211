# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [The Linux Directory Structure, Explained](https://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/)<br>
"If you’re coming from Windows, the Linux file system structure can seem particularly alien." And yeah, since I've only ever used Windows, it takes a while to learn about Linux Directory Structure.

2. [An introduction to Linux filesystems](https://opensource.com/life/16/10/introduction-linux-filesystems)<br>
High-level explanation of Linux filesystems, meaning it's not particularly an in-depth guide. Includes some situation that the authors experienced, which might happen to us as well.

3. [Linux vs Windows File Permissions](https://www.apharmony.com/software-sagacity/2014/06/linux-vs-windows-file-permissions)<br>
On the previous week I come across a statement of how Linux is much safer than Windows when it comes to virus, which is related to permissions. This site explains how Linux and Windows approach permissions in a different way.

4. [FUSE Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
A documentation of Fuse (Filesystem in Userspace). Explains the definitions and some uses of Fuse.

5. [What is ZFS? Why are People Crazy About it?](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-zfs/)<br>
An explanation of Zetta File System. I tried to GSGS for ZAFL as well but couldn't find any interesting article about it.

6. [ZFS vs NetApp's WAFL](http://uadmin.blogspot.com/2006/07/zfs-vs-netapps-wafl.html)<br>
A site I found from [a short article](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2007/03/12/comparison-of-wafl-and-zfs/) about how it's kind of impossible to compare ZFS and WAFL. The links on both site can't be found, but it's interesting to read the comments on the forum.

7. [The .asc file and what to do with it](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/the-asc-file-and-what-to-do-with-it-197351/)<br>
Tarballs have extensions like .tar.gz and .tar.bz2, but I noticed some files have .asc extensions as well and not just for tarballs.

8. [What Is a TAR File?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
An explanation of what TAR file is. It includes of some commands to open, convert, etc.

9. [What Are TAR, GZ, and BZ2?](https://blog.online-convert.com/what-are-tar-gz-and-bz2/)<br>
Short explanation and comparison between those formats. I GSGSed those because I found tar files with different extensions, but tar commands still work for both.

10. [Where the term “tarball” comes from?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/225000/where-the-term-tarball-comes-from)<br>
I thought there's a real meaning behind the term "tarball". Except that tar stands for Tape ARchive, added with a joke.
