# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Dekker’s algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dekkers-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
This link explains about Dekker's algorithm and there's more than one version of it. It's a new thing for me (mostly I read about Peterson's solution) hence I chose this link.

2. [Difference between racearound condition and deadlock](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3130079/difference-between-racearound-condition-and-deadlock)<br>
A discussion about difference between race condition and deadlock. I chose this link because I like the answers. The top answer gives and analogy as an example.

3. [How to use POSIX semaphores in C language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/)<br>
An article about semaphore usage in C. Though it doesn't give any explanation about POSIX or a link to another article about POSIX, I still chose this link because it gives an example along with the explanation.

4. [Semaphores (Multithreaded Programming Guide)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-6867/6jfpgdcnj/index.html)<br>
A documentation about semaphores. It even explains the meaning of P and V operations. Kinda hard to read, but pretty useful to understand semaphore functions.

5. [Mutex vs Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-vs-semaphore/)<br>
Basically FAQs about mutex and semaphore, and when to use which. I chose this link because it covers the general questions as well.

6. [What is POSIX? Richard Stallman explains](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/what-posix-richard-stallman-explains)<br>
A explanation of POSIX based on an interview(?). This link is interesting because some of the explanations written in a form of dialogue.

7. [Peterson’s Algorithm for Mutual Exclusion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-for-mutual-exclusion-set-1/)<br>
Peterson's algorithm is a refined version of Dekker's algorithm. I chose this link along with Dekker's algorithm article.

8. [Process Synchronization in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>
An explanation about process synchronization and other terms (critical section, race confition, etc.). It covers a lot of things but in a brief, easily-understood way.

9. [Banker's Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system)<br>
Another algorithm aside from Dekker and Peterson's, Banker's algorithm is used to avoid deadlock conditions. I like reading about algorithms so I chose this link.

10. [Test Set Lock Mechanism](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-tsl-mechanism)<br>
An explanation about TSL. I found this link when GSGSing about synchronization and it's something new for me so I chose this link.
