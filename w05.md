# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [How to Use the Linux top Command (and Understand Its Output)](https://www.howtogeek.com/668986/how-to-use-the-linux-top-command-and-understand-its-output/)<br>
A complete guide to Linux top command. It's very useful because it explains what the values mean, how to change the display, kill a process, etc. 

2. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Basically what the title says, it explains some page replacement algorithms in OS. It's quite to easy to understand because of the illustrations (just what I was looking for).

3. [Beladyâ€™s Anomaly in Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/)<br>
Another page replacement algorithm: Belady's Anomaly. Just like the previous link, it's quite easy for me to understand because of the example with illustrations. It also includes some links to some tests.

4. [Why do people call Linux a kernel rather than an OS?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/94402/why-do-people-call-linux-a-kernel-rather-than-an-os)<br>
I came across this when looking up for articles about kernel and this is new for me! Quoting from the discussion, people often just use the name of the central kernel to refer to the whole system and it's up for people to call it an OS or not.

5. [What is the Difference Between Windows Kernel and Linux Kernel](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-windows-kernel-and-linux-kernel/)<br>
This site explains about what is Windows Kernel, Linux Kernal, and the differences between those two. I looked up for this because I like to know things from comparison.

6. [Allocation of frames in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
This site explains briefly about allocation frames. It includes the advantages and disadvantages for the frame allocation algorithms as well. Although it's not very detailed, it's quite easy to get basic understanding from this article.

7. [What Is Virtual Memory? How Does It Work?](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/virtual-memory/)<br>
I found this from Google's question "Is virtual memory faster than RAM", so I looked it up. It explains what is virtual memory and its types, how it works, its difference compared to physical memory, also the answer to that question.

8. [Memory Thrashing in Operating System](http://www.firmcodes.com/memory-thrashing-in-operating-system/)<br>
Google's search algorithm gave me "advantages of thrashing in os" and I looked it up because I thought thrashing isn't a good thing. This site explains about memory thrashing and gives an example as well.

9. [A comparison of common programming languages used in bioinformatics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267699/)<br>
This article compares some programming languages in term of speed, memory, etc. I found this when I was looking for memory management comparison for commonly used programming languages.

10. [Speed up VirtualBox in Windows and run virtual machines faster](http://www.rawinfopages.com/tips/2017/07/speed-up-virtualbox-in-windows/)<br>
This guide is not that useful since I don't have any problem (yet) when it comes to VirtualBox speed and most of the solutions are related to technical issues without deep explanation, but it's still pretty interesting anyway because everyone hates it when their computer runs slow and wants to speed up things as much as possible.
