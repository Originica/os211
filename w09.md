# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Can SSDs replace all storage and memory?](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/can-ssds-replace-storage-memory/)<br>
The short answer (for the title) is no and this article explains why. It explains briefly about the comparison between HDD and SSD as well. It's interesting because most people might think SSDs are definitely better than HDD, but there might be things that are overlooked. 

2. [NVMe vs SATA: What’s the difference and which is faster?](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/why-nvme-ssds-are-faster-than-sata-ssds/)<br>
Even though it's titled NVMe vs SATA, this article focuses more on NVMe, explaining how it works. I chose this link for its explanation about NVMe SSD on the market.

3. [NVMe vs SSD vs HDD – Overview and Comparison](https://unihost.com/help/nvme-vs-ssd-vs-hdd-overview-and-comparison/)<br>
Brief explanations about what HDD, SSD, and NVMe are. Though it doesn't explain the details about the commparison, I still chose this link since it explains briefly about what's good with each and which one you should get.

4. [Hard Drives Methods And Materials](https://volga.eng.yale.edu/teaching-resources/hard-drives/methods-and-materials)<br>
So we know that HDDs use magnetically-coated material, but what's the material? This article answers that question. It doesn't answer directly about the material, but it provides microscopic images of it. It also explains about how the platter need to spin very fast, hence I chose this link.

5. [Head Crash and Scratched Platters](https://www.sertdatarecovery.com/hard-drive-data-recovery/hard-drive-head-crash-and-scratched-platters)<br>
Even with compact discs, we need to handle them carefully so the underside wouldn't get any scratches or else it'd be considered broken. It can actually happen to the hard drive as well: head crash. I was interested in this article because I was curious if there's a way to recover head crashed disks.

6. [11 Myths About NAND Flash Controllers](https://www.electronicdesign.com/industrial-automation/article/21807581/hyperstone-11-myths-about-nand-flash-controllers)<br>
This article is about common thoughts that are actually wrong, not only for SSDs but also other manageed NAND devices as well. It can be kind of enlightment hence I chose this link.

7. [Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
This articles explains about 10 disk scheduling algorithm with some questions at the end. As usual, GFG articles have easy-to-understand explanations with illustrations and those are a big help.

8. [Error Correction and Detection Codes](https://www.electronicshub.org/error-correction-and-detection-codes/)<br>
A complete explanation about definition of error, error detection and correction codes. This article is more detailed compared to GFG but still easy to understand hence I chose this one.

9. [RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)<br>
Short explanation about RAID and key evaluation points for a RAID System. I chose this link because it doesn't explain too much, but it covers the main points.

10. [How to Fix Cyclic Redundancy Check Data Error](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-cyclic-redundancy-check-data-error/)<br>
Some methods to solve Cyclic Redundancy Check Error. It's more of a technical thing, but it might be useful in the future.
