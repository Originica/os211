# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [AnimOS CPU-Scheduling](https://ess.cs.tu-dortmund.de/Software/AnimOS/CPU-Scheduling/)<br>
A CPU-Scheduling simulator where we can input processes with their arrivals and bursts. It will simulate the operations. I found this interesting and helped me understand CPU scheduling because of the illustration it gives.

2. [What is meant by CPU Burst and I/O Burst?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)<br>
A discussion about what CPU Burst and I/O Burst means. I chose this link because the answers are easy to understand and used more familiar terms. Also there's more than one answer as well.

3. [Prediction of CPU Burst Time for a process in SJF](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-prediction-of-cpu-burst-time-for-a-process-in-sjf)<br>
An explanation about approximating CPU burst time for a process in SJF (there's more than one technique). It's interesting for me about how SJF algorithm is one of the best scheduling algorithm and its problem can be approximated.

4. [Difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
A brief explanation about asymmetric and symmetric multiprocessing plus their differences. There's a lot of sites explaining about roughly the same thing but I chose this one because it's easier to understand with the illustrations.

5. [Program for Round Robin scheduling | Set 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/)<br>
An explanation about round robin scheduling with example. It's brief but covers a lot of things including the advantages, disadvantages, and example so I chose this link.

6. [Relation between Preemptive Priority and Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/relation-between-preemptive-priority-and-round-robin-scheduling-algorithm/?ref=rp)<br>
This article explains about how round robin is a preemptive scheduling. It's a complement and provides more explanation for the previous link.

7. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
I chose this link because it gives another links to articles about algorithms for both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling. 

8. [Shortest Job First (or SJF) CPU Scheduling Non-preemptive algorithm using Segment Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-job-first-or-sjf-cpu-scheduling-non-preemptive-algorithm-using-segment-tree/)<br>
An explanation about SJF scheduling an implementation of it using segment tree. I was interested in this article because it gives an example of it using a segment tree (there's another link to other implementation as well).

9. [Starvation and Aging in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/starvation-and-aging-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Starvation is a problem that might occur in scheduling and aging is a solution to it. In the midst of the explanation it also explains about differences between deadlock and starvation as well.

10. [pthreads(7) â€” Linux manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html)<br>
A Linux programmer manual about POSIX threads. Didn't seem interesting at the first glance, but after I read thoroughly, there's something about "thread-safe functions" that actually interested me hence I chose this link.
