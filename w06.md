# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [fork() in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)<br>
An explanation about fork() function in C, including some examples and difference with exec(). Like another GFG articles, this one is quite easy to understand because of the illustrations and simple language.

2. [Difference Between Concurrency and Parallelism](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism.html)<br>
A simple yet complete explanation of differences between concurrency and parallelism, including the definition of both. This site is very useful since it pretty much covers everything: definitions, comparison chart, illustration, summary, and even an explanation video.

3. [Difference between Multiprogramming, multitasking, multithreading and multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-multitasking-multithreading-and-multiprocessing/)<br>
Pretty much what the title says, this site explains the definition and difference between multiprogramming, multitasking, multithreading and multiprocessing. This is interesting because I googled for multithreading, read about multithreading vs multiprocessing, and turns out there are another similar but different terms as well.

4. [What is Context Switching in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
An explanation about context switching and how it works. Not very detailed, but it explains the steps with illustration hence I chose this.

5. [What is the purpose of fork()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985051/what-is-the-purpose-of-fork)<br>
This is a discussion about why we need to do fork(). I chose this link because even though I might understand how fork() actually works, nothing came to mind about when to use it so this discussion answered my question. 

6. [Fork bomb attack (Rabbit virus)](https://www.imperva.com/learn/ddos/fork-bomb/)<br>
The term Fork Bomb itself is already interesting hence I GSGSed about it. This site explains what fork bomb is and the examples.

7. [Zombie and Orphan Processes in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/zombie-and-orphan-processes-in-c/)<br>
An explanation about zombie and orphan processes including code snippets. I chose this because it answered my question about why zombie processes even exist.

8. [What is a race condition?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition)<br>
When writing multithreaded applications, one of the most common problems experienced is race conditions. This discussion answers questions regarding race conditions. It's interesting to read across all answers and comments instead of just reading the top answer.
 
9. [When is multi-threading not a good idea?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/93834/when-is-multi-threading-not-a-good-idea)<br>
There are issues regarding multithreading as well. Basically the top answer says that hardware switches can take more time than just running a single thread. This link is kind of interesting because based on google you can change the question to "Why multithreading is bad".

10. [Operating System - Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
This site explains about Process Scheduling and Schedulers in OS. There are sites which explain roughly the same thing, but i prefer this one since it's easier to access related articles.
